Continous Deployment is managed using Heroku  

# :page_with_curl: Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Execute this:

# This will create and activate a virtualenv. Using a virtual environment allows you to manage your project’s dependencies without messing with system-level files shared by all applications.
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or if you're still using python 2
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that all dependencies are installed, we can run the program!

```
python3 -m pytest -v tests/test_dice.py
